This free and open-source integration allows you to control your Artsauna Device via HomeAssistant, and to observe KDY Sauna devices over BLE.

It has been developed for and tested with an Artsauna Infrared Cabin Type Oslo.

The Artsauna controller used is marked as CS-128 and is most likely manufactured by china-based HiMaterial.

KDY support was added for devices advertising as `KDYSauna-*` (tested against `KDYSauna-10`). The KDY protocol is still being reverse-engineered; only fields confirmed from hardware captures are exposed.

## Supported devices

| Brand / device | Discovery name | Status |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------ |
| Artsauna (HiMaterial CS-128) | `SAUNA*` | Full control (existing) |
| KDY Sauna | `KDYSauna*` | Read-only status (phase 1) |

## Features

### Artsauna

You can control the Artsauna the same way the proprietary app would allow you to.

All relevant datapoints the sauna BLE exposes are mapped to HA entities.

Sensors:
- Target and current temperature
- Remaining time
- Current radio frequency
- RGB light color

Switches:
- Power and heating state
- Audio input and radio search mode
- Lights

Buttons:
- In- and decrease target temperature and time
- Cycle RGB light color

Numbers:
- Set audio volume

### KDY Sauna (phase 1 — reverse engineering)

KDY uses a different GATT layout (`FFF0` / `FFF1` / `FFF2` / `FFF3`) and a 22-byte `AA…CC` status frame on `FFF2`. The integration keeps a **single BLE connection** per device for status and notifications (commands will reuse that same connection once verified).

| Function | Status |
| -------- | ------ |
| Device Discovery | known (`KDYSauna*`) |
| BLE Connection | known (one shared connection) |
| FFF1 Notify | known (RAW logged; not parsed) |
| FFF2 Read/Notify | known (status frames) |
| FFF3 Write | known UUID; unused (writes not verified) |
| Power | observed (sensor, read-only) |
| Temperature (actual / target) | observed (sensors; °C as raw byte) |
| Timer (remaining minutes) | observed (sensor) |
| Innenlicht | still to verify |
| Außenlicht | still to verify |
| RGB | still to verify |
| Solltemperatur writes | still to verify |
| Commands | still to verify — **not implemented** |

Unknown status bytes are left undecoded. Enable debug logging for `custom_components.artsauna_ble.kdy_ble` to see RAW notification hex while reverse-engineering.

### Known quirks

- KDY saunas typically allow only one BLE client at a time. Do not connect another app or tool while Home Assistant is connected.
- None known for Artsauna beyond normal BLE range limits.

*Please report if you find weird behaviour!*

## Installation

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=Dacid99&repository=artsauna_ble&category=integration)

[![Add integration](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=artsauna_ble)

or install manually on your server by running these commands

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dacid99/Artsauna-ble.git
cp -r Artsauna-ble/custom_components/Artsauna_ble <ha_root>/custom_components/
```

or copying the contents manually with a filebrowser of your choice.
